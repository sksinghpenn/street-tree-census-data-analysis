Please complete each of these problems using the above data set:
1. Summarize this dataset. The actual analytics and metrics are left up to your discretion.
This problem is left intentionally unstructured, so just include a file or notebook that
describes quantitatively what this dataset contains.

2. Write code that will display the number of alive trees by species name (common) and by
borough. Include totals and percent of totals. Usage of Spark or Pandas is acceptable.

3. Create a histogram for tree_dbh (diameter of tree). What is the 90% percentile
diameter? Create a visual depiction of this histogram.

4. Write a program to determine which tree(s) have the most number of neighboring trees
within a 500 foot radius? Do notâ€‹ use Pandas, Spark or any high-level library or module.
The objective is for you to demonstrate your ability to write an efficient algorithm. What
is the complexity of your solution?
